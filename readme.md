1. trying to add duration to state. failing.
2. trying to set initial state, as method on template, but it doesn't exist when I initially pass it in. duh.
3. creating a global, getInitialState function that can be referenced locally. is this bad?
4. How to separate multiple components with child components without setting more divs on the page?
